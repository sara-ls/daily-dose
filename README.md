Tabby Katz livens browsing by adding a chance of a interactive collectible cats appearing with each page hit. Cats can be collected and viewed within the home page. Along with that, cats maintain a love meter that increases as you encounter them more often which can be viewed by clicking the top-right cat icon. 

Upon opening a new tab, you can view the cats you have encountered:

Along with that, clicking Tabby Katz icon on the top right of Chrome allows you to monitor number of encounters and the love meter for each cat : )
